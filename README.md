Ecommerce Purchases - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Project Overview
This project is aimed at mastering Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Pandas framework. The dataset contains detailed information on online purchases made by customers, and the goal is to uncover insights into customer behavior, purchasing trends, and other demographic patterns.

Dataset
The dataset used is Ecommerce Purchases.csv which contains:
•	Customer demographics (e.g., language, job title, etc.)
•	Technical details (e.g., browser, operating system)
•	Purchase details (e.g., purchase price, credit card provider, time)

Key EDA Steps
1.	Loading & Inspecting Data
o	Used head (), tail (), info (), describe () to understand structure
o	Checked for missing values
2.	Understanding Purchase Patterns
o	Analyzed average purchase price
o	Found most common purchase prices
o	Visualized top purchase amounts using bar charts
3.	Customer Demographics
o	Jobs, email providers, and language insights
o	Time-based analysis (AM/PM, specific hours)
4.	Technical Profile
o	Browser and OS usage statistics
5.	Security-Related Insights
o	Looked at credit card details, providers, and expiration patterns
o	Identified transactions from specific email domains or job titles
